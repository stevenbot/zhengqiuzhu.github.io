Zhengqiu Zhu is an assistant professor at [College of Systems Engineering, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT)](https://www.nudt.edu.cn/). He received his Ph.D. from the Crowd Computing and Simulation Intelligence group of NUDT in 2023, supervised by Prof. Zhong Liu. He was also a visiting Ph.D. student with the research group of Multiscale Networked Systems, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands for two years, supervised by [Zhiming Zhao](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/z.zhao/). Zhengqiu is interested in developing novel crowd-based sensing and computing techniques, focusing on spatial crowdsensing, embodied intelligence and human-centered AI. His research also contributes to autonomous sourcing seeking methods by UAVs and UGVs, especially in the context of urban management. He also serves as a youth editor of [The Innovation](https://www.the-innovation.org/) and deputy secretary-general of the subcommission on Large Models and Decision Intelligence.
